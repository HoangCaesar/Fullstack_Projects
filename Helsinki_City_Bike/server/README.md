1. Folder explanation:

- bin: where we create server and listen to a port.

- src/api/v1 (v1 means version 1):
    + controllers: receive requests from app, handle requests and response back.
    + databases: initialize databases, such as mongoDB and redis.
    + helpers: small functions - used to handle a couple of small tasks like: validation, error handler...
    + html: contains html file (nodemailer used to send to client.)
    + logs: contain event logs
    + middlewares: in this project, it will verify access/refresh token (not truly needed now)
    + models: define schema and generate form of data in mongodb
    + routes: define routes of a whole app
    + services: is called by controllers to find out data from databases.

- tests: test controllers and services.
